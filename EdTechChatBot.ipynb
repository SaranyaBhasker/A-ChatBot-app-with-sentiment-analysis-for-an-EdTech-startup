      "\n",
      "In addition to practical educational experience, educational technology is based on theoretical knowledge from various disciplines such as communication, education, psychology, sociology, artificial intelligence, and computer science.[5][full citation needed] It encompasses several domains including learning theory, computer-based training, online learning, and m-learning, where mobile technologies are used.\n",

      "Definition [ edit ]\n",
      "\n",
      "The Association for Educational Communications and Technology (AECT) defined educational technology as \"the study and ethical practice of facilitating learning and improving performance by creating, using and managing appropriate technological processes and resources\".[6] It denoted instructional technology as \"the theory and practice of design, development, utilization, management, and evaluation of processes and resources for learning\".[7][8][9] As such, educational technology refers to all valid and reliable applied education sciences, such as equipment, as well as processes and procedures that are derived from scientific research, and in a given context may refer to theoretical, algorithmic or heuristic processes: it does not necessarily imply physical technology. Educational technology is the process of integrating technology into education in a positive manner that promotes a more diverse learning environment and a way for students to learn how to use technology as well as their common assignments.\n",
      "\n",
      "Accordingly, there are several discrete aspects to describing the intellectual and technical development of educational technology:\n",
      "\n",
      "Related terms [ edit ]\n",
      "\n",
      "Educational technology is an inclusive term for both the material tools, processes, and the theoretical foundations for supporting learning and teaching. Educational technology is not restricted to high technology but is anything that enhances classroom learning in the utilization of blended, face to face, or online learning.[11]\n",
      "\n",
      "An educational technologist is someone who is trained in the field of educational technology. Educational technologists try to analyze, design, develop, implement, and evaluate process and tools to enhance learning.[12] While the term educational technologist is used primarily in the United States, learning technologist is synonymous and used in the UK[13] as well as Canada.\n",
      "\n",
      "Modern electronic educational technology is an important part of society today.[14] Educational technology encompasses e-learning, instructional technology, information and communication technology (ICT) in education, EdTech, learning technology, multimedia learning, technology-enhanced learning (TEL), computer-based instruction (CBI), computer managed instruction, computer-based training (CBT), computer-assisted instruction or computer-aided instruction (CAI),[15] internet-based training (IBT), flexible learning, web-based training (WBT), online education, digital educational collaboration, distributed learning, computer-mediated communication, cyber-learning, and multi-modal instruction, virtual education, personal learning environments, networked learning, virtual learning environments (VLE) (which are also called learning platforms), m-learning, ubiquitous learning and digital education.\n",
      "\n",
      "Each of these numerous terms has had its advocates, who point up potential distinctive features.[16] However, many terms and concepts in educational technology have been defined nebulously; for example, Fiedler's review of the literature found a complete lack agreement of the components of a personal learning environment. Moreover, Moore saw these terminologies as emphasizing particular features such as digitization approaches, components or delivery methods rather than being fundamentally dissimilar in concept or principle.[16] For example, m-learning emphasizes mobility, which allows for altered timing, location, accessibility and context of learning; nevertheless, its purpose and conceptual principles are those of educational technology.[16]\n",
      "\n",
      "In practice, as technology has advanced, the particular \"narrowly defined\" terminological aspect that was initially emphasized by name has blended into the general field of educational technology.[16] Initially, \"virtual learning\" as narrowly defined in a semantic sense implied entering an environmental simulation within a virtual world, for example in treating posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).[17][18] In practice, a \"virtual education course\" refers to any instructional course in which all, or at least a significant portion, is delivered by the Internet. \"Virtual\" is used in that broader way to describe a course that is not taught in a classroom face-to-face but through a substitute mode that can conceptually be associated \"virtually\" with classroom teaching, which means that people do not have to go to the physical classroom to learn. Accordingly, virtual education refers to a form of distance learning in which course content is delivered by various methods such as course management applications, multimedia resources, and videoconferencing.[19] Virtual education and simulated learning opportunities, such as games or dissections, offer opportunities for students to connect classroom content to authentic situations.[20]\n",

      "Educational content, pervasively embedded in objects, is all around the learner, who may not even be conscious of the learning process.[21] The combination of adaptive learning, using an individualized interface and materials, which accommodate to an individual, who thus receives personally differentiated instruction, with ubiquitous access to digital resources and learning opportunities in a range of places and at various times, has been termed smart learning.[22][23][24] Smart learning is a component of the smart city concept.[25][26]\n",

      "Helping people and children learn in ways that are easier, faster, more accurate, or less expensive can be traced back to the emergence of very early tools, such as paintings on cave walls.[27][28] Various types of abacus have been used. Writing slates and blackboards have been used for at least a millennium.[29] From their introduction, books and pamphlets have held a prominent role in education. From the early twentieth century, duplicating machines such as the mimeograph and Gestetner stencil devices were used to produce short copy runs (typically 10–50 copies) for classroom or home use. The use of media for instructional purposes is generally traced back to the first decade of the 20th century[30] with the introduction of educational films (1900s) and Sidney Pressey's mechanical teaching machines (1920s). The first all multiple choice, large-scale assessment was the Army Alpha, used to assess the intelligence and, more specifically, the aptitudes of World War I military recruits. Further large-scale use of technologies was employed in training soldiers during and after WWII using films and other mediated materials, such as overhead projectors. The concept of hypertext is traced to the description of memex by Vannevar Bush in 1945.\n",

      "Online education originated from the University of Illinois in 1960. Although the internet would not be created for another nine years, students were able to access class information with linked computer terminals. The first online course was offered in 1986 by the Electronic University Network for DOS and Commodore 64 computers. Computer Assisted Learning eventually offered the first online courses with real interaction. In 2002, MIT began providing online classes free of charge. As of 2009 , approximately 5.5 million students were taking at least one class online. Currently, one out of three college students takes at least one online course while in college. At DeVry University, out of all students that are earning a bachelor's degree, 80% earn two-thirds of their requirements online. Also, in 2014, 2.85 million students out of 5.8 million students that took courses online, took all of their courses online. From this information, it can be concluded that the number of students taking classes online is on the steady increase.[33][34]\n",

      "In the recent article, “Shift happens: online education as a new paradigm in learning,\" Linda Harasim covers an overview on the history of online education as well as a framework for understanding the type of need it addresses, the concept of distance learning has already been invented for many centuries. The value of online education is not found in its ability to have established a method for distance learning, but rather in its power to make this type of learning process more efficient by providing a medium in which the instructor and their students can virtually interact with one another in real time. The topic of online education started primarily in the late 1900s when institutions and businesses started to make products to assist students’ learning. These groups desired a need to further develop educational services across the globe, primarily to developing countries. In 1960, the University of Illinois created a system of linked computer terminals, known as the Intranet, to give students access to recorded lectures and course materials that they could watch or use on their free time. This type of concept, called PLATO (programmed logic for automatic teaching operations), was rapidly introduced throughout the globe. Many institutions adopted this similar technique while the internet was in its developmental phase.\n",

      "In 1971, Ivan Illich published a hugely influential book, Deschooling Society, in which he envisioned \"learning webs\" as a model for people to network the learning they needed. The 1970s and 1980s saw notable contributions in computer-based learning by Murray Turoff and Starr Roxanne Hiltz at the New Jersey Institute of Technology[35] as well as developments at the University of Guelph in Canada.[36] In the UK, the Council for Educational Technology supported the use of educational technology, in particular administering the government's National Development Programme in Computer Aided Learning[37] (1973–77) and the Microelectronics Education Programme (1980–86).\n",

      "Digitized communication and networking in education started in the mid-1980s. Educational institutions began to take advantage of the new medium by offering distance learning courses using computer networking for information. Early e-learning systems, based on computer-based learning/training often replicated autocratic teaching styles whereby the role of the e-learning system was assumed to be for transferring knowledge, as opposed to systems developed later based on computer supported collaborative learning (CSCL), which encouraged the shared development of knowledge.\n",

      "Videoconferencing was an important forerunner to the educational technologies known today. This work was especially popular with museum education. Even in recent years, videoconferencing has risen in popularity to reach over 20,000 students across the United States and Canada in 2008–2009. Disadvantages of this form of educational technology are readily apparent: image and sound quality is often grainy or pixelated; videoconferencing requires setting up a type of mini-television studio within the museum for broadcast, space becomes an issue, and specialised equipment is required for both the provider and the participant.[38]\n",

      "Various pedagogical perspectives or learning theories may be considered in designing and interacting with educational technology. E-learning theory examines these approaches. These theoretical perspectives are grouped into three main theoretical schools or philosophical frameworks: behaviorism, cognitivism and constructivism.\n",
      "\n",
      "Behaviorism [ edit ]\n",
      "\n",
      "This theoretical framework was developed in the early 20th century based on animal learning experiments by Ivan Pavlov, Edward Thorndike, Edward C. Tolman, Clark L. Hull, and B.F. Skinner. Many psychologists used these results to develop theories of human learning, but modern educators generally see behaviorism as one aspect of a holistic synthesis. Teaching in behaviorism has been linked to training, emphasizing the animal learning experiments. Since behaviorism consists of the view of teaching people how to do something with rewards and punishments, it is related to training people.[52]\n",
      "\n",
      "B.F. Skinner wrote extensively on improvements of teaching based on his functional analysis of verbal behavior[53][54] and wrote \"The Technology of Teaching\",[55][56] an attempt to dispel the myths underlying contemporary education as well as promote his system he called programmed instruction. Ogden Lindsley developed a learning system, named Celeration, that was based on behavior analysis but that substantially differed from Keller's and Skinner's models.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cognitivism [ edit ]\n",
      "\n",
      "Cognitive science underwent significant change in the 1960s and 1970s to the point that some described the period as a \"cognitive revolution\" particularly in reaction to behaviorism.[57] While retaining the empirical framework of behaviorism, cognitive psychology theories look beyond behavior to explain brain-based learning by considering how human memory works to promote learning. It refers to learning as \"all processes by which the sensory input is transformed, reduced, elaborated, stored, recovered, and used\" by the human mind.[57][58] The Atkinson-Shiffrin memory model and Baddeley's working memory model were established as theoretical frameworks. Computer Science and Information Technology have had a major influence on Cognitive Science theory. The Cognitive concepts of working memory (formerly known as short-term memory) and long-term memory have been facilitated by research and technology from the field of Computer Science. Another major influence on the field of Cognitive Science is Noam Chomsky. Today researchers are concentrating on topics like cognitive load, information processing, and media psychology. These theoretical perspectives influence instructional design.[59]\n",
      "\n",
      "There are two separate schools of cognitivism, and these are the cognitivist and social cognitivist. The former focuses on the understanding of the thinking or cognitive processes of an individual while the latter includes social processes as influences in learning besides cognition.[60] These two schools, however, share the view that learning is more than a behavioral change but is rather a mental process used by the learner.[60]\n",
      "\n",
      "Constructivism [ edit ]\n",
      "\n",
      "Educational psychologists distinguish between several types of constructivism: individual (or psychological) constructivism, such as Piaget's theory of cognitive development, and social constructivism. This form of constructivism has a primary focus on how learners construct their own meaning from new information, as they interact with reality and with other learners who bring different perspectives. Constructivist learning environments require students to use their prior knowledge and experiences to formulate new, related, and/or adaptive concepts in learning (Termos, 2012[61]). Under this framework the role of the teacher becomes that of a facilitator, providing guidance so that learners can construct their own knowledge. Constructivist educators must make sure that the prior learning experiences are appropriate and related to the concepts being taught. Jonassen (1997) suggests \"well-structured\" learning environments are useful for novice learners and that \"ill-structured\" environments are only useful for more advanced learners. Educators utilizing a constructivist perspective may emphasize an active learning environment that may incorporate learner centered problem-based learning, project-based learning, and inquiry-based learning, ideally involving real-world scenarios, in which students are actively engaged in critical thinking activities. An illustrative discussion and example can be found in the 1980s deployment of constructivist cognitive learning in computer literacy, which involved programming as an instrument of learning.[62]: 224 LOGO, a programming language, embodied an attempt to integrate Piagetan ideas with computers and technology.[62][63] Initially there were broad, hopeful claims, including \"perhaps the most controversial claim\" that it would \"improve general problem-solving skills\" across disciplines.[62]: 238 However, LOGO programming skills did not consistently yield cognitive benefits.[62]: 238 It was \"not as concrete\" as advocates claimed, it privileged \"one form of reasoning over all others,\" and it was difficult to apply the thinking activity to non-LOGO-based activities.[64] By the late 1980s, LOGO and other similar programming languages had lost their novelty and dominance and were gradually de-emphasized amid criticisms.[65]\n",

For example, \"hybrid learning\" or \"blended learning\" may refer to classroom aids and laptops, or may refer to approaches in which traditional classroom time is reduced but not eliminated, and is replaced with some online learning.[68][69] \"Distributed learning\" may describe either the e-learning component of a hybrid approach, or fully online distance learning environments.[66]\n",

At the professional educational level, training may include virtual operating rooms. Asynchronous learning is beneficial for students who have health problems or who have child care responsibilities. They have the opportunity to complete their work in a low-stress environment and within a more flexible time frame.[40] In asynchronous online courses, students are allowed the freedom to complete work at their own pace. Being a non-traditional student, they can manage their daily life and school with and still have the social aspect. Asynchronous collaborations allow the student to reach out for help when needed and provides helpful guidance, depending on how long it takes them to complete the assignment. Many tools used for these courses are but not limited to: videos, class discussions, and group projects.[74] Through online courses, students can earn their diplomas faster, or repeat failed courses without being in a class with younger students. Students have access to an incredible variety of enrichment courses in online learning, and still participate in college courses, internships, sports, or work and still graduate with their class.\n",

CBT initially delivered content via CD-ROM, and typically presented content linearly, much like reading an online book or manual.[75] For this reason, CBT is often used to teach static processes, such as using software or completing mathematical equations. Computer-based training is conceptually similar to web-based training (WBT), which is delivered via Internet using a web browser.\n",

CSCL is similar in concept to the terminology, \"e-learning 2.0\" and \"networked collaborative learning\" (NCL).[76] With Web 2.0 advances, sharing information between multiple people in a network has become much easier and use has increased.[75][77]: 1 [78] One of the main reasons for its usage states that it is \"a breeding ground for creative and engaging educational endeavors.\"[77]: 2 Learning takes place through conversations about content and grounded interaction about problems and actions. This collaborative learning differs from instruction in which the instructor is the principal source of knowledge and skills.[75] The neologism \"e-learning 1.0\" refers to direct instruction used in early computer-based learning and training systems (CBL). In contrast to that linear delivery of content, often directly from the instructor's material, CSCL uses social software such as blogs, social media, wikis, podcasts, cloud-based document portals, and discussion groups and virtual worlds.[79] This phenomenon has been referred to as Long Tail Learning.[80] Advocates of social learning claim that one of the best ways to learn something is to teach it to others.[80] Social networks have been used to foster online learning communities around subjects as diverse as test preparation and language education. mobile-assisted language learning (MALL) is the use of handheld computers or cell phones to assist in language learning.\n",

Besides, the virtual classroom provides a social learning environment that replicates the traditional \"brick and mortar\" classroom. Most virtual classroom applications provide a recording feature. Each class is recorded and stored on a server, which allows for instant playback of any class over the course of the school year.

One prominent class of AI-enhanced educational technology is intelligent tutoring systems (ITSs), designed to provide immediate and personalized feedbacks to students. The incentive to develop ITS comes from educational studies showing that individual tutoring is much more effective than group teaching,[124][125] in addition to the need for promoting learning on a larger scale. Over the years, a combination of cognitive science theories and data-driven techniques have greatly enhanced the capabilities of ITS, allowing it to model a wide range of students' characteristics, such as knowledge,[126] affect,[127] off-task behavior[128] and wheel spinning.[129] There is ample evidence that ITSs are highly effective in helping students learn.[130] ITSs can be used to keep students in the zone of proximal development (ZPD): the space wherein students may learn with guidance. Such systems can guide students through tasks slightly above their ability level.[131]\n",

On the other hand, AI can share the workload and recommend the best course of actions (e.g., by pointing out which students require the most help), but can only operate in the pre-specified domain and cannot handle tasks such as providing emotional support or remedial lessons to students in need.[133] However, existing systems were designed under the assumption that students progress at the same pace.[134] Understanding how to support teachers in a realistic, highly differentiated, self-paced classroom, remains an open research problem.[132]\n",

Some options that are age-appropriate are video- or audio- recording of their creations, introducing them to the use of the internet through browsing age-appropriate websites, providing assistive technology to allow differently-abled children to participate with the rest of their peers,[139] educational apps, electronic books, and educational videos.[140] There are many free and paid educational website and apps that are directly targeting the educational needs of preschool children. These include Starfall, ABC mouse,[140] PBS Kids Video, Teachme, and Montessori crosswords.[141] Educational technology in the form of electronic books [109] offer preschool children the option to store and retrieve several books on one device, thus bringing together the traditional action of reading along with the use of educational technology. Educational technology is also thought to improve hand-eye coordination, language skills, visual attention and motivation to complete educational tasks, and allows children to experience things they otherwise would not.[citation needed] There are several keys to making the most educational use out of introducing technology at the preschool level: technology must be used appropriately, should allow access to learning opportunities, should include the interaction of parents and other adults with the preschool children, and should be developmentally appropriate.[142] Allowing access to learning opportunities especially for allowing disabled children to have access to learning opportunities, giving bilingual children the opportunity to communicate and learn in more than one language, bringing in more information about STEM subjects, and bringing in images of diversity that may be lacking in the child's immediate environment.[142]\n",

Private institutions may become more involved with on-line presentations as the costs decrease. Properly trained staff must also be hired to work with students online.[155] These staff members need to understand the content area, and also be highly trained in the use of the computer and Internet.

      "Although massive open online courses (MOOCs) may have limitations that preclude them from fully replacing college education,[157] such programs have significantly expanded. MIT, Stanford and Princeton University offer classes to a global audience, but not for college credit.[158] University-level programs, like edX founded by Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Harvard University, offer wide range of disciplines at no charge, while others permit students to audit a course at no charge but require a small fee for accreditation. MOOCs have not had a significant impact on higher education and declined after the initial expansion, but are expected to remain in some form.[159] Lately, MOOCs are used by smaller universities to profile themselves with highly specialized courses for special-interest audiences, as for example in a course on technological privacy compliance.[160]\n",

Using online resources can help students spend more time on specific aspects of what they may be learning in school, but at home. Schools like the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) have made certain course materials free online.[177] Although some aspects of a classroom setting are missed by using these resources, they are helpful tools to add additional support to the educational system.

      "According to James Kulik, who studies the effectiveness of computers used for instruction, students usually learn more in less time when receiving computer-based instruction, and they like classes more and develop more positive attitudes toward computers in computer-based classes. Students can independently solve problems.[172] There are no intrinsic age-based restrictions on difficulty level, i.e. students can go at their own pace. Students editing their written work on word processors improve the quality of their writing. According to some studies, the students are better at critiquing and editing written work that is exchanged over a computer network with students they know.[174] Studies completed in \"computer intensive\" settings found increases in student-centric, cooperative and higher-order learning, writing skills, problem solving, and using technology.[180] In addition, attitudes toward technology as a learning tool by parents, students and teachers are also improved.\n",

Examples include silent film, broadcast radio, and television, none of which have maintained much of a foothold in the daily practices of mainstream, formal education.[185] Technology, in and of itself, does not necessarily result in fundamental improvements to educational practice.[186] The focus needs to be on the learner's interaction with technology—not the technology itself. It needs to be recognized as \"ecological\" rather than \"additive\" or \"subtractive\". In this ecological change, one significant change will create total change.[187]\n",

      "According to Branford et al., \"technology does not guarantee effective learning,\" and inappropriate use of technology can even hinder it.[20] A University of Washington study of infant vocabulary shows that it is slipping due to educational baby DVDs. Published in the Journal of Pediatrics, a 2007 University of Washington study on the vocabulary of babies surveyed over 1,000 parents in Washington and Minnesota. The study found that for every one hour that babies 8–16 months of age watched DVDs and Videos, they knew 6-8 fewer of 90 common baby words than the babies that did not watch them. Andrew Meltzoff, a surveyor in this study, states that the result makes sense, that if the baby's \"alert time\" is spent in front of DVDs and TV, instead of with people speaking, the babies are not going to get the same linguistic experience. Dr. Dimitri Chistakis, another surveyor reported that the evidence is mounting that baby DVDs are of no value and may be harmful.[188][189][190][191]\n",

      "Massively open online courses (MOOCs), although quite popular in discussions of technology and education in developed countries (more so in the US), are not a major concern in most developing or low-income countries. One of the stated goals of MOOCs is to provide less fortunate populations (i.e., in developing countries) an opportunity to experience courses with US-style content and structure. However, research shows only 3% of the registrants are from low-income countries and although many courses have thousands of registered students only 5-10% of them complete the course.[193] This can be attributed to lack of staff support, course difficulty and low levels of engagement with peers.[194] MOOCs also implies that certain curriculum and teaching methods are superior, and this could eventually wash over (or possibly washing out) local educational institutions, cultural norms and educational traditions.[195]\n",

      "With the Internet and social media, using educational apps makes the students highly susceptible to distraction and sidetracking. Even though proper use has shown to increase student performances, being distracted would be detrimental. Another disadvantage is an increased potential for cheating.[196] One method is done by creating multiple accounts to survey questions and gather information which can be assimilated so that the master account is able to fill in the correct answers. Smartphones can be very easy to hide and use inconspicuously, especially if their use is normalized in the classroom. These disadvantages can be managed with strict rules and regulations on mobile phone use.\n",

      "Electronic devices such as cellphones and computers facilitate rapid access to a stream of sources, each of which may receive cursory attention. Michel Rich, an associate professor at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the center on Media and Child Health in Boston, said of the digital generation, \"Their brains are rewarded not for staying on task, but for jumping to the next thing. The worry is we're raising a generation of kids in front of screens whose brains are going to be wired differently.\"[197] Students have always faced distractions; computers and cellphones are a particular challenge because the stream of data can interfere with focusing and learning. Although these technologies affect adults too, young people may be more influenced by it as their developing brains can easily become habituated to switching tasks and become unaccustomed to sustaining attention.[197] Too much information, coming too rapidly, can overwhelm thinking.[198]\n",

This leads to heightened stress levels on the brain that, at first, boost energy levels, but, over time, actually augment memory, impair cognition, lead to depression, alter the neural circuitry of the hippocampus, amygdala and prefrontal cortex. These are the brain regions that control mood and thought. If unchecked, the underlying structure of the brain could be altered.[197][199] Over-stimulation due to technology may begin too young. When children are exposed before the age of seven, important developmental tasks may be delayed, and bad learning habits might develop, which \"deprives children of the exploration and play that they need to develop.\"[200] Media psychology is an emerging specialty field that embraces electronic devices and the sensory behaviors occurring from the use of educational technology in learning.\n",

      "Leo Marx considered the word \"technology\" itself as problematic,[203] susceptible to reification and \"phantom objectivity\", which conceals its fundamental nature as something that is only valuable insofar as it benefits the human condition. Technology ultimately comes down to affecting the relations between people, but this notion is obfuscated when technology is treated as an abstract notion devoid of good and evil. Langdon Winner makes a similar point by arguing that the underdevelopment of the philosophy of technology leaves us with an overly simplistic reduction in our discourse to the supposedly dichotomous notions of the \"making\" versus the \"uses\" of new technologies and that a narrow focus on \"use\" leads us to believe that all technologies are neutral in moral standing.[202]: ix–39 These critiques would have us ask not, \"How do we maximize the role or advancement of technology in education?\", but, rather, \"What are the social and human consequences of adopting any particular technology?\"\n",

      "Winner viewed technology as a \"form of life\" that not only aids human activity, but that also represents a powerful force in reshaping that activity and its meaning.[202]: ix–39 For example, the use of robots in the industrial workplace may increase productivity, but they also radically change the process of production itself, thereby redefining what is meant by \"work\" in such a setting. In education, standardized testing has arguably redefined the notions of learning and assessment. We rarely explicitly reflect on how strange a notion it is that a number between, say, 0 and 100 could accurately reflect a person's knowledge about the world. According to Winner, the recurring patterns in everyday life tend to become an unconscious process that we learn to take for granted. Winner writes,\n",

      "By far, the greatest latitude of choice exists the very first time a particular instrument, system, or technique is introduced. Because choices tend to become strongly fixed in material equipment, economic investment, and social habit, the original flexibility vanishes for all practical purposes once the initial commitments are made. In that sense, technological innovations are similar to legislative acts or political foundings that establish a framework for public order that will endure over many generations. (p. 29)\n",

      "When adopting new technologies, there may be one best chance to \"get it right.\" Seymour Papert (p. 32) points out a good example of a (bad) choice that has become strongly fixed in social habit and material equipment: our \"choice\" to use the QWERTY keyboard.[204] The QWERTY arrangement of letters on the keyboard was originally chosen, not because it was the most efficient for typing, but because early typewriters were prone to jam when adjacent keys were struck in quick succession. Now that typing has become a digital process, this is no longer an issue, but the QWERTY arrangement lives on as a social habit, one that is very difficult to change.\n",

These infrastructures collect information such as learning management system logins, library metrics, impact measurements, teacher evaluation frameworks, assessment systems, learning analytic traces, longitudinal graduate outcomes, attendance records, social media activity, and so on. The copious amounts of information collected are quantified for the marketization of higher education, employing this data as a means to demonstrate and compare student performance across institutions to attract prospective students, mirroring the capitalistic notion of ensuring efficient market functioning and constant improvement through measurement.[210] This desire of data has fueled the exploitation of higher education by platform companies and data service providers who are outsourced by institutions for their services.

      "Formative assessment is more difficult, as the perfect form is ongoing and allows the students to show their learning in different ways depending on their learning styles. Technology has helped some teachers make their formative assessments better, particularly through the use of classroom response systems (CRS).[218] A CRS is a tool in which the students each have a handheld device that partners up with the teacher's computer. The instructor then asks multiple choice or true or false questions and the students answer on their device.[218] Depending on the software used, the answers may then be shown on a graph so students and the teacher can see the percentage of students who gave each answer and the teacher can focus on what went wrong.[219]\n",
      "\n",
      "Summative assessments are more common in classrooms and are usually set up to be more easily graded, as they take the form of tests or projects with specific grading schemes. One huge benefit of tech-based testing is the option to give students immediate feedback on their answers. When students get these responses, they are able to know how they are doing in the class which can help push them to improve or give them confidence that they are doing well.[220] Technology also allows for different kinds of summative assessment, such as digital presentations, videos, or anything else the teacher/students may come up with, which allows different learners to show what they learned more effectively.[220] Teachers can also use technology to post graded assessments online for students to have a better idea of what a good project is.\n",

Tolman, Clark L. Hull, and B.F. Skinner.', 'Many psychologists used these results to develop theories of human learning, but modern educators generally see behaviorism as one aspect of a holistic synthesis.', 'Teaching in behaviorism has been linked to training, emphasizing the animal learning experiments.', 'Since behaviorism consists of the view of teaching people how to do something with rewards and punishments, it is related to training people.', '[52]\\n\\nB.F. Skinner wrote extensively on improvements of teaching based on his functional analysis of verbal behavior[53][54] and wrote \"The Technology of Teaching\",[55][56] an attempt to dispel the myths underlying contemporary education as well as promote his system he called programmed instruction.', \"Ogden Lindsley developed a learning system, named Celeration, that was based on behavior analysis but that substantially differed from Keller's and Skinner's models.\", 'Cognitivism [ edit ]\\n\\nCognitive science underwent significant change in the 1960s and 1970s to the point that some described the period as a \"cognitive revolution\" particularly in reaction to behaviorism.', '[57] While retaining the empirical framework of behaviorism, cognitive psychology theories look beyond behavior to explain brain-based learning by considering how human memory works to promote learning.', 'It refers to learning as \"all processes by which the sensory input is transformed, reduced, elaborated, stored, recovered, and used\" by the human mind.', \"[57][58] The Atkinson-Shiffrin memory model and Baddeley's working memory model were established as theoretical frameworks.\", 'Computer Science and Information Technology have had a major influence on Cognitive Science theory.', 'The Cognitive concepts of working memory (formerly known as short-term memory) and long-term memory have been facilitated by research and technology from the field of Computer Science.', 'Another major influence on the field of Cognitive Science is Noam Chomsky.', 'Today researchers are concentrating on topics like cognitive load, information processing, and media psychology.', 'These theoretical perspectives influence instructional design.', '[59]\\n\\nThere are two separate schools of cognitivism, and these are the cognitivist and social cognitivist.', 'The former focuses on the understanding of the thinking or cognitive processes of an individual while the latter includes social processes as influences in learning besides cognition.', '[60] These two schools, however, share the view that learning is more than a behavioral change but is rather a mental process used by the learner.', \"[60]\\n\\nConstructivism [ edit ]\\n\\nEducational psychologists distinguish between several types of constructivism: individual (or psychological) constructivism, such as Piaget's theory of cognitive development, and social constructivism.\", 'This form of constructivism has a primary focus on how learners construct their own meaning from new information, as they interact with reality and with other learners who bring different perspectives.', 'Constructivist learning environments require students to use their prior knowledge and experiences to formulate new, related, and/or adaptive concepts in learning (Termos, 2012[61]).', 'Under this framework the role of the teacher becomes that of a facilitator, providing guidance so that learners can construct their own knowledge.', 'Constructivist educators must make sure that the prior learning experiences are appropriate and related to the concepts being taught.', 'Jonassen (1997) suggests \"well-structured\" learning environments are useful for novice learners and that \"ill-structured\" environments are only useful for more advanced learners.', 'Educators utilizing a constructivist perspective may emphasize an active learning environment that may incorporate learner centered problem-based learning, project-based learning, and inquiry-based learning, ideally involving real-world scenarios, in which students are actively engaged in critical thinking activities.', 'An illustrative discussion and example can be found in the 1980s deployment of constructivist cognitive learning in computer literacy, which involved programming as an instrument of learning.', '[62]: 224 LOGO, a programming language, embodied an attempt to integrate Piagetan ideas with computers and technology.', '[62][63] Initially there were broad, hopeful claims, including \"perhaps the most controversial claim\" that it would \"improve general problem-solving skills\" across disciplines.', '[62]: 238 However, LOGO programming skills did not consistently yield cognitive benefits.', '[62]: 238 It was \"not as concrete\" as advocates claimed, it privileged \"one form of reasoning over all others,\" and it was difficult to apply the thinking activity to non-LOGO-based activities.', '[64] By the late 1980s, LOGO and other similar programming languages had lost their novelty and dominance and were gradually de-emphasized amid criticisms.', '[65]\\n\\nPractice [ edit ]\\n\\nThe extent to which e-learning assists or replaces other learning and teaching approaches is variable, ranging on a continuum from none to fully online distance learning.', '[66][67] A variety of descriptive terms have been employed (somewhat inconsistently) to categorize the extent to which technology is used.', 'For example, \"hybrid learning\" or \"blended learning\" may refer to classroom aids and laptops, or may refer to approaches in which traditional classroom time is reduced but not eliminated, and is replaced with some online learning.', '[68][69] \"Distributed learning\" may describe either the e-learning component of a hybrid approach, or fully online distance learning environments.', '[66]\\n\\nSynchronous and asynchronous [ edit ]\\n\\nE-learning may either be synchronous or asynchronous.', 'Synchronous learning occurs in real-time, with all participants interacting at the same time, while asynchronous learning is self-paced and allows participants to engage in the exchange of ideas or information without the dependency of other participants′ involvement at the same time.', '[70]\\n\\nSynchronous learning refers to the exchange of ideas and information with one or more participants during the same period.', 'Examples are face-to-face discussion, online real-time live teacher instruction and feedback, Skype conversations, and chat rooms or virtual classrooms where everyone is online and working collaboratively at the same time.', 'Since students are working collaboratively, synchronized learning helps students become more open-minded because they have to actively listen and learn from their peers.', \"Synchronized learning fosters online awareness and improves many students' writing skills.\", '[71]\\n\\nAsynchronous learning may use technologies such as learning management systems, email, blogs, wikis, and discussion boards, as well as web-supported textbooks,[72] hypertext documents, audio[73] video courses, and social networking using web 2.0.', 'At the professional educational level, training may include virtual operating rooms.', 'Asynchronous learning is beneficial for students who have health problems or who have child care responsibilities.', 'They have the opportunity to complete their work in a low-stress environment and within a more flexible time frame.', '[40] In asynchronous online courses, students are allowed the freedom to complete work at their own pace.', 'Being a non-traditional student, they can manage their daily life and school with and still have the social aspect.', 'Asynchronous collaborations allow the student to reach out for help when needed and provides helpful guidance, depending on how long it takes them to complete the assignment.', 'Many tools used for these courses are but not limited to: videos, class discussions, and group projects.', '[74] Through online courses, students can earn their diplomas faster, or repeat failed courses without being in a class with younger students.', 'Students have access to an incredible variety of enrichment courses in online learning, and still participate in college courses, internships, sports, or work and still graduate with their class.', 'Linear learning [ edit ]\\n\\nComputer-based training (CBT) refers to self-paced learning activities delivered on a computer or handheld device such as a tablet or smartphone.', 'CBT initially delivered content via CD-ROM, and typically presented content linearly, much like reading an online book or manual.', '[75] For this reason, CBT is often used to teach static processes, such as using software or completing mathematical equations.', 'Computer-based training is conceptually similar to web-based training (WBT), which is delivered via Internet using a web browser.', 'Assessing learning in a CBT is often by assessments that can be easily scored by a computer such as multiple-choice questions, drag-and-drop, radio button, simulation or other interactive means.', 'Assessments are easily scored and recorded via online software, providing immediate end-user feedback and completion status.', 'Users are often able to print completion records in the form of certificates.', '[75]\\n\\nCBTs provide learning stimulus beyond traditional learning methodology from textbook, manual, or classroom-based instruction.', 'CBTs can be a good alternative to printed learning materials since rich media, including videos or animations, can be embedded to enhance the learning.', '[75]\\n\\nHowever, CBTs pose some learning challenges.', 'Typically, the creation of effective CBTs requires enormous resources.', 'The software for developing CBTs is often more complex than a subject matter expert or teacher is able to use.', '[75] The lack of human interaction can limit both the type of content that can be presented and the type of assessment that can be performed and may need supplementation with online discussion or other interactive elements.', 'Collaborative learning [ edit ]\\n\\nComputer-supported collaborative learning (CSCL) uses instructional methods designed to encourage or require students to work together on learning tasks, allowing social learning.', 'CSCL is similar in concept to the terminology, \"e-learning 2.0\" and \"networked collaborative learning\" (NCL).', '[76] With Web 2.0 advances, sharing information between multiple people in a network has become much easier and use has increased.', '[75][77]: 1 [78] One of the main reasons for its usage states that it is \"a breeding ground for creative and engaging educational endeavors.', '\"[77]: 2 Learning takes place through conversations about content and grounded interaction about problems and actions.', 'This collaborative learning differs from instruction in which the instructor is the principal source of knowledge and skills.', '[75] The neologism \"e-learning 1.0\" refers to direct instruction used in early computer-based learning and training systems (CBL).', \"In contrast to that linear delivery of content, often directly from the instructor's material, CSCL uses social software such as blogs, social media, wikis, podcasts, cloud-based document portals, and discussion groups and virtual worlds.\", '[79] This phenomenon has been referred to as Long Tail Learning.', '[80] Advocates of social learning claim that one of the best ways to learn something is to teach it to others.', '[80] Social networks have been used to foster online learning communities around subjects as diverse as test preparation and language education.', 'mobile-assisted language learning (MALL) is the use of handheld computers or cell phones to assist in language learning.', 'Collaborative apps allow students and teachers to interact while studying.', 'Apps are designed after games, which provide a fun way to revise.', 'When the experience is enjoyable, the students become more engaged.', 'Games also usually come with a sense of progression, which can help keep students motivated and consistent while trying to improve.', '[81]\\n\\nClassroom 2.0 refers to online multi-user virtual environments (MUVEs) that connect schools across geographical frontiers.', 'Known as \"eTwinning\", computer-supported collaborative learning (CSCL) allows learners in one school to communicate with learners in another that they would not get to know otherwise,[82][83] enhancing educational outcomes[84] and cultural integration.', 'Further, many researchers distinguish between collaborative and cooperative approaches to group learning.', 'For example, Roschelle and Teasley (1995) argue that \"cooperation is accomplished by the division of labour among participants, as an activity where each person is responsible for a portion of the problem solving\", in contrast with collaboration that involves the \"mutual engagement of participants in a coordinated effort to solve the problem together.', '\"[85]\\n\\nSocial technology, and social media specifically, provides avenues for student learning that would not be available otherwise.', 'For example, it provides ordinary students a chance to exist in the same room as, and share a dialogue with researchers, politicians, and activists.', 'This is because it vaporizes the geographical barriers that would otherwise separate people.', '[86] Simplified, social media gives students a reach that provides them with opportunities and conversations that allow them to grow as communicators.', '[87]\\n\\nSocial technologies like Twitter can provide students with an archive of free data that goes back for multiple decades.', 'Many classrooms and educators are already taking advantage of this free resource—for example, researchers and educators at the University of Central Florida in 2011 used Tweets posted relating to emergencies like Hurricane Irene as data-points, in order to teach their students how to code data.', '[88][89] Social media technologies also allow instructors the ability to show students how professional networks facilitate work on a technical level.', '[90]\\n\\nFlipped classroom [ edit ]\\n\\nThis is an instructional strategy in which computer-assisted teaching is integrated with classroom instruction.', 'Students are given basic essential instruction, such as lectures, before class instead of during class.', 'Instructional content is delivered outside of the classroom, often online.', 'The out-of-class delivery includes streaming video, reading materials, online chats, and other resources.', '[91] This frees up classroom time for teachers to more actively engage with learners.', '[92]\\n\\nTechnologies [ edit ]\\n\\nA 2.5m teaching slide rule compared to a normal sized model\\n\\nEducational media and tools can be used for:\\n\\ntask structuring support: help with how to do a task (procedures and processes),\\n\\naccess to knowledge bases (help user find information

used:[93][94] digital cameras, video cameras, interactive whiteboard tools, document cameras, electronic media, and LCD projectors.', 'Combinations of these techniques include blogs, collaborative software, ePortfolios, and virtual classrooms.', '[95]\\n\\nThe current design of this type of applications includes the evaluation through tools of cognitive analysis that allow to identify which elements optimize the use of these platforms.', '[96]\\n\\nAudio and video [ edit ]\\n\\nPreparation for training teachers on the subject of Wikipedia - Center for Educational Technology\\n\\nVideo technology[97] has included VHS tapes and DVDs, as well as on-demand and synchronous methods with digital video via server or web-based options such as streamed video and webcams.', 'Telecommuting can connect with speakers and other experts.', 'Interactive digital video games are being used at K-12 and higher education institutions.', '[98]\\n\\nRadio offers a synchronous educational vehicle, while streaming audio over the internet with webcasts and podcasts can be asynchronous.', 'Classroom microphones, often wireless, can enable learners and educators to interact more clearly.', 'Screencasting allows users to share their screens directly from their browser and make the video available online so that other viewers can stream the video directly.', '[99] The presenter thus has the ability to show their ideas and flow of thoughts rather than simply explain them as simple text content.', 'In combination with audio and video, the educator can mimic the one-on-one experience of the classroom.', 'Learners have the ability to pause and rewind, to review at their own pace, something a classroom cannot always offer.', 'Webcams and webcasting have enabled the creation of virtual classrooms and virtual learning environment.', '[100] Webcams are also being used to counter plagiarism and other forms of academic dishonesty that might occur in an e-learning environment.', 'Computers, tablets and mobile devices [ edit ]\\n\\nTeaching and learning online\\n\\nCollaborative learning is a group-based learning approach in which learners are mutually engaged in a coordinated fashion to achieve a learning goal or complete a learning task.', 'With recent developments in smartphone technology, the processing powers and storage capabilities of modern mobiles allow for advanced development and the use of apps.', 'Many app developers and education experts have been exploring smartphone and tablet apps as a medium for collaborative learning.', 'Computers and tablets enable learners and educators to access websites as well as applications.', 'Many mobile devices support m-learning.', '[101]\\n\\nMobile devices such as clickers and smartphones can be used for interactive audience response feedback.', '[102] Mobile learning can provide performance support for checking the time, setting reminders, retrieving worksheets, and instruction manuals.', '[103][104]\\n\\nSuch devices as iPads are used for helping disabled (visually impaired or with multiple disabilities) children in communication development as well as in improving physiological activity, according to the iStimulation Practice Report.', '[105]\\n\\nComputers in the classroom have been shown to increase rates of engagement and interest when computers and smart devices are utilized educationally in classrooms.', '[106][107][better source needed]\\n\\nCollaborative and social learning [ edit ]\\n\\nGroup webpages, blogs, wikis, and Twitter allow learners and educators to post thoughts, ideas, and comments on a website in an interactive learning environment.', '[108][109] Social networking sites are virtual communities for people interested in a particular subject to communicate by voice, chat, instant message, video conference, or blogs.', '[110] The National School Boards Association found that 96% of students with online access have used social networking technologies, and more than 50% talk online about schoolwork.', 'Social networking encourages collaboration and engagement[111] and can be a motivational tool for self-efficacy amongst students.', '[112]\\n\\nWhiteboards [ edit ]\\n\\nInteractive whiteboard in 2007\\n\\nThere are three types of whiteboards.', '[113] The initial whiteboards, analogous to blackboards, date from the late 1950s.', 'The term whiteboard is also used metaphorically to refer to virtual whiteboards in which computer software applications simulate whiteboards by allowing writing or drawing.', 'This is a common feature of groupware for virtual meetings, collaboration, and instant messaging.', 'Interactive whiteboards allow learners and instructors to write on the touch screen.', 'The screen markup can be on either a blank whiteboard or any computer screen content.', 'Depending on permission settings, this visual learning can be interactive and participatory, including writing and manipulating images on the interactive whiteboard.', '[113]\\n\\nVirtual classroom [ edit ]\\n\\nA virtual learning environment (VLE), also known as a learning platform, simulates a virtual classroom or meetings by simultaneously mixing several communication technologies.', 'Web conferencing software enables students and instructors to communicate with each other via webcam, microphone, and real-time chatting in a group setting.', 'Participants can raise hands, answer polls, or take tests.', 'Students can whiteboard and screencast when given rights by the instructor, who sets permission levels for text notes, microphone rights, and mouse control.', '[114]\\n\\nA virtual classroom provides an opportunity for students to receive direct instruction from a qualified teacher in an interactive environment.', 'Learners can have direct and immediate access to their instructor for instant feedback and direction.', 'The virtual classroom provides a structured schedule of classes, which can be helpful for students who may find the freedom of asynchronous learning to be overwhelming.', 'Besides, the virtual classroom provides a social learning environment that replicates the traditional \"brick and mortar\" classroom.', 'Most virtual classroom applications provide a recording feature.', 'Each class is recorded and stored on a server, which allows for instant playback of any class over the course of the school year.', 'This can be extremely useful for students to retrieve missed material or review concepts for an upcoming exam.', 'Parents and auditors have the conceptual ability to monitor any classroom to ensure that they are satisfied with the education the learner is receiving.', 'In higher education especially, a virtual learning environment (VLE) is sometimes combined with a management information system (MIS) to create a managed learning environment, in which all aspects of a course are handled through a consistent user interface throughout the institution.', 'Physical universities and newer online-only colleges offer to select academic degrees and certificate programs via the Internet.', 'Some programs require students to attend some campus classes or orientations, but many are

fundamental nature as something that is only valuable insofar as it benefits the human condition.', 'Technology ultimately comes down to affecting the relations between people, but this notion is obfuscated when technology is treated as an abstract notion devoid of good and evil.', 'Langdon Winner makes a similar point by arguing that the underdevelopment of the philosophy of technology leaves us with an overly simplistic reduction in our discourse to the supposedly dichotomous notions of the \"making\" versus the \"uses\" of new technologies and that a narrow focus on \"use\" leads us to

rather, \"What are the social and human consequences of adopting any particular technology?\"', 'Winner viewed technology as a \"form of life\" that not only aids human activity, but that also represents a powerful force in reshaping that activity and its meaning.', '[202]: ix–39 For example, the use of robots in the industrial workplace may increase productivity, but they also radically change the process of production itself, thereby redefining what is meant by \"work\" in such a setting.', 'In education, standardized testing has arguably redefined the notions of learning and

difficult.', 'Random professional development days are inadequate.', '[213]\\n\\nAccording to Jenkins, \"Rather than dealing with each technology in isolation, we would do better to take an ecological approach, thinking about the interrelationship among different communication technologies, the cultural communities that grow up around them, and the activities they support.', '\"[207] Jenkins also suggested that the traditional school curriculum guided teachers to train students to be autonomous problem solvers.', \"[207] However, today's workers are increasingly asked to work in teams, drawing on different sets of expertise, and collaborating to solve problems.\", '[207] Learning styles and the methods of collecting information have evolved, and \"students often feel locked out of the worlds described in their textbooks through the depersonalized and abstract prose used to describe them\".', '[207] These twenty-first century skills can be attained through the incorporation and engagement with technology.', '[214] Changes in instruction and use of technology can also promote a higher level of learning among students with different types of intelligence.', '[215]\\n\\nAssessment [ edit ]\\n\\nThere are two distinct issues of assessment: the assessment of educational technology[207][216] and assessment with technology.', '[217]\\n\\nAssessments of educational technology have included the Follow Through project.', 'Educational assessment with technology may be either formative assessment or summative assessment.', 'Instructors use both types of assessments to understand student progress and learning in the classroom.', 'Technology has helped teachers create better assessments to help understand where students who are having trouble with the material are having issues.', 'Formative assessment is more difficult, as the perfect form is ongoing and allows the students to show their learning in different ways depending on their learning styles.', 'Technology has helped some teachers make their formative assessments better, particularly through the use of classroom response systems (CRS).', \"[218] A CRS is a tool in which the students each have a handheld device that partners up with the teacher's computer.\", 'The instructor then asks multiple choice or true or false questions and the students answer on their device.', '[218] Depending on the software used, the answers may then be shown on a graph so students and the teacher can see the percentage of students who gave each answer and the teacher can focus on what went wrong.', '[219]\\n\\nSummative assessments are more common in classrooms and are usually set up to be more easily graded, as they take the form of tests or projects with specific grading schemes.', 'One huge benefit of tech-based testing is the option to give students immediate feedback on their answers.', 'When students get these responses, they are able to know how they are doing in the class which can help push them to improve or give them confidence that they are doing well.', '[220] Technology also allows for different kinds of summative assessment, such as digital presentations, videos, or anything else the teacher/students may come up with, which allows different learners to show what they learned more effectively.', '[220] Teachers can also use technology to post graded assessments online for students to have a better idea of what a good project is.', 'Electronic assessment uses information technology.', 'It encompasses several potential applications, which may be teacher or student-oriented, including educational assessment throughout the continuum of learning, such as computerized classification testing, computerized adaptive testing, student testing, and grading an exam.', 'E-Marking is an examiner led activity closely related to other e-assessment activities such as e-testing, or e-learning which are student-led.', 'E-marking allows markers to mark a scanned script or online response on a computer screen rather than on paper.', 'There are no restrictions on the types of tests that can use e-marking, with e-marking applications designed to accommodate multiple choice, written, and even video submissions for performance examinations.', 'E-marking software is used by individual educational institutions and can also be rolled out to the participating schools of awarding exam organisations.', 'E-marking has been used to mark many well known high stakes examinations, which in the United Kingdom include A levels and GCSE exams, and in the US includes the SAT test for college admissions.', 'Ofqual reports that e-marking is the main type of marking used for general qualifications in the United Kingdom.', 'In 2014, the Scottish Qualifications Authority (SQA) announced that most of the National 5 question papers would be e-marked.', '[221]\\n\\nIn June 2015, the Odisha state government in India announced that it planned to use e-marking for all Plus II papers from 2016.', '[222]\\n\\nAnalytics [ edit ]\\n\\nThe importance of self-assessment through tools made available on Educational Technology platforms has been growing.', 'Self-assessment in education technology relies on students analyzing their strengths, weaknesses and areas where improvement is possible to set realistic goals in learning, improve their educational performances and track their progress.', '[223][224] One of the unique tools for self-assessment made possible by education technology is Analytics.', \"Analytics is data gathered on the student's activities on the learning platform, drawn into meaningful patterns that lead to a valid conclusion, usually through the medium of data visualization such as graphs.\", \"Learning analytics is the field that focuses on analyzing and reporting data about student's activities in order to facilitate learning.\", 'Expenditure [ edit ]\\n\\nThe five key sectors of the e-learning industry are consulting, content, technologies, services and support.', '[225] Worldwide, e-learning was estimated in 2000 to be over $48 billion according to conservative estimates.', '[226] Commercial growth has been brisk.', '[227][228] In 2014, the worldwide commercial market activity was estimated at $6 billion venture capital over the past five years,[227]: 38 with self-paced learning generating $35.6 billion in 2011.', '[227]: 4 North American e-learning generated $23.3 billion in revenue in 2013, with a 9% growth rate in cloud-based authoring tools and learning platforms.', '[227]: 19\\n\\nCareers [ edit ]\\n\\nEducational technologists and psychologists apply basic educational and psychological research into an evidence-based applied science (or a technology) of learning or instruction.', \"In research, these professions typically require a graduate degree (Master's, Doctorate, Ph.D., or D.Phil.)\", 'in a field related to educational psychology, educational media, experimental psychology, cognitive psychology or, more purely, in the fields of educational, instructional or human performance technology or instructional design.', 'In industry, educational technology is utilized to train students and employees by a wide range of learning and communication practitioners, including instructional designers, technical trainers, technical communication and professional communication specialists, technical writers, and of course primary school and college teachers of all levels.', 'The transformation of educational technology from a cottage industry to a profession is discussed by Shurville et al.', '[229]\\n\\nSee also [ edit ]']\n"
